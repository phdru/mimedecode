WHAT IS IT

   Mail users, especially in non-English countries, often find that mail
messages arrived in different formats, with different content types, in
different encodings and charsets. Usually this is good because it allows
us to use appropriate format/encoding/whatever. Sometimes, though, some
unification is desirable. For example, one may want to put mail messages
into an archive, make HTML indices, run search indexer, etc. In such
situations converting messages to text in one character set and skipping
some binary attachments is much desirable.

   Here is the solution - mimedecode.

   This is a program to decode MIME messages. The program expects one
input file (either on command line or on stdin) which is treated as an
RFC822 message, and decodes to stdout or an output file. If the file is
not an RFC822 message it is just copied to the output one-to-one. If the
file is a simple RFC822 message it is decoded as one part. If it is a
MIME message with multiple parts ("attachments") all parts are decoded.
Decoding can be controlled by command-line options.

   Think about said mail archive; for example, its maintainer wants to
put there only texts, convert PDF/Postscript to text, pass HTML and
images decoding base64 to html but leaving images encoded, and ignore
everything else. This is how it could be done:

   mimedecode -t application/pdf -t application/postscript -t text/plain -b text/html -B 'image/*' -i '*/*'
